### Header

Terminate these steps if header is a case-insensitive match for one of the following headers:

* Accept-Charset
* Accept-Encoding
* Access-Control-Request-Headers
* Access-Control-Request-Method
* Connection
* Content-Length
* Cookie
* Cookie2
* Date
* DNT
* Expect
* Host
* Keep-Alive
* Origin
* Referer
* TE
* Trailer
* Transfer-Encoding
* Upgrade
* User-Agent
* Via

â€¦ or if the start of header is a case-insensitive match for `Proxy-` or `Sec-` (including when header is just `Proxy-` or `Sec-` ).

The above headers are controlled by the user agent to let it control those aspects of transport. This guarantees data integrity to some extent. Header names starting with `Sec-` are not allowed to be set to allow new headers to be minted that are guaranteed not to come fromXMLHttpRequest.
